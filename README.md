The online lottery game is a simple Python application where the player selects 7 numbers from 1 to 20
and places a bet. After the draw, the winnings are determined based on the number of matches, and the bet amount affects the size of the winnings.
The player starts with 10€ in play money, and the goal is to reach 500€ or avoid running out of funds.
